  abstract = {Drought is one of the abiotic stresses controlling plant function and ecological stability. In the context of climate change, drought is predicted to occur more frequently in the future. Despite numerous attempts to clarify the overall effects of drought stress on the growth and physiological processes of plants, a comprehensive evaluation on the impacts of drought stress on biomass allocation, especially on reproductive tissues, remains elusive. We conducted a meta-analysis by synthesizing 164 published studies to elucidate patterns of plant biomass allocation in relation to drought stress. Results showed that drought significantly increased the fraction of root mass but decreased that of stem, leaf, and reproductive mass. Roots of herbaceous plants were more sensitive to drought than woody plants that reduced reproductive allocation more sharply than the former. Relative to herbaceous plants, drought had a more negative impact on leaf mass fraction of woody plants. Among the herbaceous plants, roots of annuals responded to drought stress more strongly than perennial herbs, but their reproductive allocation was less sensitive to drought than the perennial herbs. In addition, cultivated and wild plants seemed to respond to drought stress in a similar way. Drought stress did not change the scaling exponents of the allometric relationship between different plant tissues. These findings suggest that the allometric partitioning theory, rather than the optimal partitioning theory, better explains the drought-induced changes in biomass allocation strategies.},

  abstract = {Functional ecology often analyses a few selected traits and relates them either to environmental conditions or ecosystem properties. However, not the individual trait, but the whole plant with a set of coordinated traits responds to the environment or affects ecosystem properties. Here we argue that the correlation among traits of all major plant organs should be an integral part of response or effect studies. Plants allocate elements and biomass among roots, perennial clonal organs, stems, leaves and seeds to ensure growth and reproduction. Assessment of trait responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems is hardly possible without simultaneously considering all plant organs and the biological functions they perform, namely resource uptake, vegetative regeneration, support and hydraulic pathways, photosynthesis and generative reproduction. Suitable traits to indicate these functions include those of mass, density, size, volume, and element contents of the main plant organs. In principle, we do not propose to collect many traits, but those of similar significance across organs. For instance, specific leaf area should be complemented by specific root length and specific stem length. We present some thoughts on how coordinated allocation to biological functions sets boundaries to the range of trait expressions in successional series and consequently also to species responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems. Considering the coordination of traits amongst all major plant organs will improve our understanding of plant strategies ensuring survival in patterned landscapes. Zusammenfassung Die funktionelle Ökologie analysiert häufig nur einige wenige ausgewählte biologische Merkmale und setzt sie mit Umweltbedingungen oder Ökosystemeigenschaften in Beziehung. Allerdings reagiert nicht nur das einzelne ausgewählte Merkmal auf Umweltveränderungen bzw. beeinflusst Ökosystemeigenschaften, sondern die ganze Pflanze mit einer Reihe untereinander koordinierter Merkmale. Wir vertreten die Auffassung, dass die Korrelationen zwischen Merkmalen aller relevanten Pflanzenorgane integraler Bestandteil von Untersuchungen sein sollten, welche Merkmale in Bezug zur Umwelt setzen. Gefäßpflanzen verteilen Elemente und Biomasse auf Wurzeln, klonale Organe wie Rhizome, Stängel, Blätter und Samen, um Wachstum und Reproduktion sicherzustellen. Die Bewertung von Reaktionen von biologischen Merkmalen auf die Umwelt oder ihres Effektes auf Ökosystemeigenschaften sind kaum möglich, wenn nicht alle Organe und ihre biologischen Funktionen berücksichtigt werden, namentlich Nährstoffaufnahme, vegetative Regeneration, Stützfunktionen und Wassertransport, Photosynthese und generative Reproduktion. Geeignete Merkmale, die diese Funktionen kennzeichnen können, sind unter anderem Masse, Dichte, Größe, Volumen und Elementgehalt der Pflanzenorgane. Es kommt unserer Meinung nach nicht auf die Quantität von Traits an, die an einem Individuum bestimmt werden, sondern auf solche mit ähnlicher Bedeutung. So sollte die spezifische Blattfläche mit spezifischer Wurzel- und Stängellänge ergänzt werden. Im Folgenden diskutieren wir, wie eine koordinierte Allokation zu den wichtigsten biologischen Funktionen den Umfang an Merkmalsexpressionen in Sukzessionsserien begrenzt und damit auch die Reaktionen von Arten auf die Umwelt sowie ihre Effekte auf Ökosystemeigenschaften. Die Berücksichtigung der Merkmalskorrelationen aller Organe kann unser Verständnis von Pflanzenstrategien wesentlich verbessern.},

  abstract = {Passioura, J.B., 1983. Roots and drought resistance. Agric. Water Manage., 7: 265–280. The influence of roots on the yield of water-limited crops is analysed with the help of the identity: yield = water used × water-use efficiency × harvest index Despite being severely water-stressed, many droughted crops leave substantial amounts of apparently available water in the subsoil at maturity. The factors influencing this amount are outlined, particularly those concerning the morphology of the root system. Prospects for improving yield by extracting the residual water are discussed. Because roots are difficult to harvest, water-use efficiency is usually defined as above-ground-biomass/water-used. It follows that the more assimilate a plant transfers to its roots the lower will be its water-use efficiency. There is presumably an optimal root/ shoot ratio (in terms of water relations) at which above-ground biomass is maximal for a given water supply. This ratio appears to exceed the optimum in many cases. For a given biomass, the yield of a grain crop depends in part on the pattern of water use during the season, because harvest index is often related to the proportion of the total water supply that is used after anthesis. For crops relying on a limited supply of stored water, a high axial resistance to flow in the roots may ensure that water in the subsoil is not used so quickly that too little remains at anthesis for the plants to set and fill an adequate number of grains. A breeding program aimed at changing this resistance in wheat roots is described. Finally, the principles are discussed on which physiological research can be useful in improving drought resistance. The need to dissect water-limited yield into largely independent components is emphasised, for such a dissection greatly improves the focus of the research.},

  abstract = {Allocation is one of the central concepts in modern ecology, providing the basis for different strategies. Allocation in plants has been conceptualized as a proportional or ratio-driven process (‘partitioning’). In this view, a plant has a given amount of resources at any point in time and it allocates these resources to different structures. But many plant ecological processes are better understood in terms of growth and size than in terms of time. In an allometric perspective, allocation is seen as a size-dependent process: allometry is the quantitative relationship between growth and allocation. Therefore most questions of allocation should be posed allometrically, not as ratios or proportions. Plants evolve allometric patterns in response to numerous selection pressures and constraints, and these patterns explain many behaviours of plant populations. In the allometric view, plasticity in allocation can be understood as a change in a plant's allometric trajectory in response to the environment. Some allocation patterns show relatively fixed allometric trajectories, varying in different environments primarily in the speed at which the trajectory is travelled, whereas other allocation patterns show great flexibility in their behaviour at a given size. Because plant growth is often indeterminate and its rate highly influenced by environmental conditions, ‘plasticity in size’ is not a meaningful concept. We need a new way to classify, describe and analyze plant allocation and plasticity because the concepts ‘trait’ and ‘plasticity’ are too broad. Three degrees of plasticity can be distinguished: (1) allometric growth (‘apparent plasticity’), (2) modular proliferation and local physiological adaptation, and (3) integrated plastic responses. Plasticity, which has evolved because it increases individual fitness, can be a disadvantage in plant production systems, where we want to optimize population, not individual, performance.},

## R Julian

In addition to the Simile models, we have also created the same models in R again.
These have the same model components and also the same input values as the models in Simile.
Our main motivation behind the R models was to avoid the very time-consuming drawing of the organ fractions.
By using R, we could read the data directly from the table and were not dependent on an intermediate medium such as the Simile graphs.
While Simile is operated entirely via a graphical user interface, our R model is based purely on a line-based script.
This made it sometimes difficult to keep an overview, because the characteristic components of Simile were not directly visible in the R code. Nevertheless, the model is also based on factors, compartments and flows that have to be defined at the beginning.
Here the numeric() function is useful to create vectors for the variables that change during the simulation.
For each of these variables, a vector is created with the length of the planned timesteps.
These vectors are then exchanged with the newly calculated data points during the simulation.
For constant factors, variables are defined with the corresponding constant value at the beginning.
For compartment variables, the first digit in the associated vector is overwritten with the start value of the compartment from Simile.
